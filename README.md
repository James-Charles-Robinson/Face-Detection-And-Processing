# Face-Detection-And-Processing
Three python scripts that detect faces in videos and photos, can save those faces or can blur them out and save a final image.
# How To Use
1. Download the dependancies
2. Put your input images or videos in the input folder
3. If you just want the saved faces then run the collect.py file or if you want the faces in images/videos to be blurred then run the blur.py program.
4. If you want to delete very simular faces from your faces folder run the delete.py file, this deletes faces that are almost the same.
